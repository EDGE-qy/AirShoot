# AirShoot

This is a chessboard game, which is famous among middle school students when they are bored during *Wanzixi*.

The rule of the game is, two players play on two different boards. At first, every player set some **aero**es on the board without overlap, consisting of **head** and **body**. Then two players take actions one by one, choose a grid of the opponent, and shoot. Each shoot will receive a message of whether it's head, body, or nothing. Note that the shooter will not be reminded which aero the part of body belong to. After rounds, the one who shoots out all aero heads of the opponent wins the game.

The aim of the repo is to first develop a two-player offline version, and then use the API to train an AI model, finally set up a web server to test it online, through which I hope to learn more about programming on AI. The main language in the early stage is python because it fits AI training.

Have fun!
